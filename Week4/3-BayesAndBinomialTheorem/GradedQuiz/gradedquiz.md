10. An Urn contains two white marbles and one black marble. A marble is drawn from the Urn without replacement and put aside without my seeing it. Then a second marble is drawn, and it is white. What is the probability that the unknown removed marble is white, and what is the probability that it is black?
    [] p(the first marble is white∣the second marble is white)=0.3333
        p(the first marble is black∣the second marble is white)=0.6667
    [] p(the first marble is white∣the second marble is white)=0.6667
